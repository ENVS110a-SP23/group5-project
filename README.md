Data Analysis for Environmental Studies

Background:
According to the EPA, research has well-established a link between asthma, a chronic respiratory disease that affects more than 23 million Americans and a rise in air pollution. Air pollution may exacerbate symptoms of asthma or trigger asthma attacks, and children are even more vulnerable to experiencing worsened symptoms of asthma due to air pollution. Studies have found that minority communities are disproportionately affected by asthma exacerbated by air pollution because they are often settled in low-income urban housing areas with increased exposure to both indoor and outdoor pollutants, creating an equity and climate justice problem as well as a public health concern.

The EPA collects air quality data at outdoor monitors across the U.S. to track pollutants in different cities across the country. Our group will compare historical AQI data with the rates of asthma cases from various state government public data sources (listed below) to see how prevalent asthma is in 4 major cities across the U.S: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. We chose these cities because of their large population size, cultural and political significance, and because they are spread across the country so as to provide a more representative spatial analysis of our topic. We will then determine if cities that had higher mean scores on the AQI over a 7 year period also had higher rates of asthma reported within the same 7 year period.

Research Question:
How is anthropogenic activity contributing to the threat of air pollution to human health? Is there a direct correlation between minority communities and bad air pollution?
Is there a correlation between AQI and rates of asthma in urban areas?

Data sets we are using:
U.S. Historical Population Data from World Bank:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=US 
Will be used to calculate per-capita asthma cases to ensure that increased rates of asthma are not only a result of growing population
AQI data from EPA https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data
Asthma in California

Hypothesis & Next Steps:
We hypothesize that the data surrounding rising air pollution in U.S. cities has a positive correlation with the rise in childhood asthma cases. 
Daniel will take the lead on data pre-processing and cleaning
Maggie will work on data visualization
Nicholas will focus on data analysis and statistics
