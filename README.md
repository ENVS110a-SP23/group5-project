Data Analysis for Environmental Studies

Background:
According to the EPA, research has well-established a link between asthma, a chronic respiratory disease that affects more than 23 million Americans and a rise in air pollution. Air pollution may exacerbate symptoms of asthma or trigger asthma attacks, and children are even more vulnerable to experiencing worsened symptoms of asthma due to air pollution. Studies have found that minority communities are disproportionately affected by asthma exacerbated by air pollution because they are often settled in low-income urban housing areas with increased exposure to both indoor and outdoor pollutants, creating an equity and climate justice problem as well as a public health concern.

The EPA collects air quality data at outdoor monitors across the U.S. to track pollutants in different cities across the country. The state of California also has publicly available data with summary statistics for asthma prevelance in different parts of the state. Our group with compare AQI data from 2015 with prevelance of asthma cases in 2015-2016 from the state of California to see if counties with more air pollution also had higher prevelance of asthma that year.

Research Question:
Is there a correlation between air pollution (indicated by a high AQI) and asthma rates based on California health data?

Data sets we are using:
AQI data from EPA https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data
Asthma prevelance in California
https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/EHIB/CPE/Pages/CaliforniaBreathingCountyAsthmaProfiles.aspx 


Hypothesis & Next Steps:
We hypothesize that the data surrounding rising air pollution in California has a positive correlation with the rise in childhood asthma cases. 
Daniel will take the lead on data pre-processing and cleaning
Maggie will work on data visualization
Nicholas will focus on data analysis and statistics
